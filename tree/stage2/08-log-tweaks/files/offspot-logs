In a regular Offspot config:

All messages to syslog are discarded.
This can be changed in /etc/rsyslog.conf by commenting-out the `*.* ~` line.
This requires restarting the service: `systemctl restart rsyslog`

Additionnaly, systemd's journald is volatile: not persisting logs accross reboots.
It also sets a limit to the journal size.
This can be disabled in /etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/00-offspot-volatile.conf
This requires restarting the service: `systemctl restart systemd-journald`

Additionnaly, /var/log is mounted as tmpfs.
This can be changed by commenting-out according line in /etc/fstab.
This requires remounting: `mount -o remount /var/log`.
If files are busy in /var/log, stop related services before remounting (or just restart)
